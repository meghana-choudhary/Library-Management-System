# Library-Management-System

The project is on a Library Management System that stores details of a book like its price, status and the total number of books available in the library. It can be used by user to check different books along with their titles categorically and also to issue books. This automated system is more helpful and easy than the manual writing system. I have used my knowledge of SQL in this project to create tables, then add data in them and finally have Stored Procedure Query Questions.
